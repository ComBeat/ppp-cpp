1.  A program computes by taking an input and produces an output
2.  Input = Entering some data through an input device (keyboard,...)
    Output = Output of the computed data
3.  -Correctly
    -Simply
    -Efficiently
4.  An expression computes a value from a number of operands
5.  Same as an expression, but computes several values.
6.  Variable used on the left-hand side of an assignemnt =.
7.  A variable which value can't be changed accidentally after initialization.
8.  A literal is a hard-coded value. But isn't represented through a variable.
9.  Evaluated at compile time. A symbolic constant won't change (i.e. const).
10. Magic constant only conveys the value, but the intent behind it, remains unclear
    Maintaind such code is annoying, because you'd have to change the same number at several ocassions, instead of just one.
11. +, ++, -, --, *, /.
12. %
13. <<, >>
14. When multiple if statements of number-type (e.g. int,...) are going to be evaluated.
15. break; be forgotten often.
16. Part 1: initialises the count variable; Part 2: declares when the loop ends part3: how many steps are used for cpunting up . left to rigth
17. for: when smt is iterated with each step
    while: a function is repeated several times
18. convert -> int
19. 
20. use piece of code in other classes
    or several times
21. increase it
22. concatenate ist
